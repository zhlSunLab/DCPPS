# FFC-PSP

FFC-PSP provides the prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation site using deep leraning.

# Requirement

    python == 3.7
    
    keras == 2.4.0
    
    tensorflow == 2.4.0

    numpy >= 1.8.0

    backend == tensorflow

# Predict For Your Test Data

cd to the FFC-PSP fold

If you want to predict kinase-specific site, taking MAPK as a example, run:

    First change the filename in predict.py and then python predict.py.

# Train For Your own Data

     change the filename and python train.py.
